Beyond agriculture, I am also committed to research that safeguards natural ecosystems. By integrating Landsat panel data with fixed-effects regression models at Saguaro National Park, I evaluated the effectiveness of herbicide treatments in reducing invasive species and promoting native plant recovery. These results inform evidence-based strategies to mitigate ecological disturbances, illustrating how spatially explicit analyses can guide practical conservation decisions.
