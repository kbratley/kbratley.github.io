title: "Mapping Agricultural Change"
collection: portfolio

My research examines how farmland expansions, reclamation projects, and abandonment shape environmental systems. In Egypt, I generated the first national-scale land-cover and land-use change map, which revealed both newly cultivated areas in former desert regions and unexpected farmland abandonment. These findings offer critical insights into how urbanization, policy decisions, and ecological factors collectively influence agricultural viability and sustainability. Check out the results through [this interactive app](https://kelseebratley.users.earthengine.app/view/egypt-land-cover-interactive-tool), built using Google Earth Engine to visualize land cover change across Egypt.
