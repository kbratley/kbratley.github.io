title: "Remote Sensing for Agriculture in Data-Scarce Regions"

Another key focus of my work is the application of remote sensing and statistical methods in areas with limited data availability. In collaboration with the IMF, the UN World Food Programme, and Digital Earth Africa, I developed Mozambique’s first national-scale map of agricultural extent, leveraging machine learning for robust land-cover classification.

Under NASA SERVIR, I extended this approach to central and northern Ghana, where I applied CCDC to map annual and perennial agriculture, and also conducted fieldwork to collect ground-truth data in 2024. This field validation underscored both the complexity of sub-Saharan agricultural systems and the need for iterative, ground-informed remote sensing approaches. Drawing from these experiences, I am preparing a dissertation chapter that critically reviews current and emerging methods for mapping agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, aiming to drive scalable, evidence-based land management across the region.

To illustrate these challenges in detail, the example below shows agricultural fields outlined in red—highlighting why it is difficult to classify annual agriculture through remote sensing alone. Planted pastures, which often appear in distict geometric patterns, can be mistaken for active cropland when interpreting high-resolution imagery. Meanwhile, truly active fields that include significant woody vegetation (common across vast regions of Africa) may be missed if relying solely on optical data. This discrepancy is illustrated by the cassava field shown below. These images were captured during fieldwork in central Ghana in March 2023.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd5c6ab4-ebee-4675-b064-822b531e68f3)
