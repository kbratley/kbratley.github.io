Iâ€™m a land-use scientist in the final year of my PhD at Boston University, where I work under the guidance of [Curtis Woodcock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vf8DeC4AAAAJ&hl=en). I plan to defend my dissertation in July 2025. My research focuses on the dynamic interactions between human-driven land cover change and climate change to develop innovative solutions to pressing environmental challenges. My work is interdisciplinary and highly collaborative, and Iâ€™m always open to engaging in new projects where I can apply my expertise in fresh and unfamiliar contexts. You can explore my [Research] and [Publications] for a more detailed overview of my work.
